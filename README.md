Welcome to Pig-Game. Created utilising JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

Guide: 
- The first player to bank a score of 100 or above wins.
- Players must roll the dice, and are free to roll as many times as they want. 
- When the player is satisfied with the current total number, they can click 'Hold' which banks the number accrued. 
- If before the player clicks 'Hold', they roll the number 1, they will lose their accrued number value and it will be the other player's turn.
- Dependent on who's turn it is UX has been thought through; colors change to visually aid the players to allow them to see which player is next.
- When the game is finished, the winner will have a black container to signifiy victory.
- Clicking New Game resets all current numbers.
